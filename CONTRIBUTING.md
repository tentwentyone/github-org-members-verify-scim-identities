# contributing

The following document contains a set of rules that should be followed if you plan on contributing on this project.

## commiting your changes

All the commits should be subject to the [four-eyes principle](https://www.unido.org/overview/member-states/change-management/faq/what-four-eyes-principle) ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€.

> _The four-eyes principle means that a certain activity, i.e. a decision, transaction, etc., **must be approved by at least two people**. This controlling mechanism is used to facilitate **delegation of authority** and **increase transparency**._
>
> _This approach not only ensures the efficiency of processes by **enabling fast decision-making** while **ensuring effective control and monitoring**, but also **brings about cultural change**. Staff members are able to perform these processes irrespective whether they are at Headquarters or in the field._

All the commits should be verified commits âœ”âœ”.
